# Kiosk Mode

The primary goal of the article is, to set up a system which does not require any manual authentication to display the openITCOCKPIT web interface. Often this is used to running openITCOCKPIT on a large wall mounted TV screen.

!!! danger
    Please be aware of that when you setup a Kiosk System, any person who has access to the kiosk
    has also access to your openITCOCKPIT system.
    It is highly recommended to create a separate user for this with very low permissions.
    See [User management](/en/configuration/usermanagement/#managing-user-roles) for more information about user permissions.

First of all, you have to create a new user in openITCOCKPIT, which has very low user permissions. While you create the user, please make sure to also create a new [API key](/en/development/api/#api-keys) and copy the key. [API keys](/en/development/api/#api-keys) can also be created later on.


In the next step, install the browser extension [SimpleModifyHeaders](https://github.com/didierfred/SimpleModifyHeaders) on your kiosk system. The SimpleModifyHeaders browser extension will add the API key to all requests done by the browser automatically, so openITCOCKPIT will no longer ask for any login credentials.

- SimpleModifyHeaders for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-modify-headers/gjgiipmpldkpbdfjkgofildhapegmmic)
- SimpleModifyHeaders for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simple-modify-header/)


Create a new Request Header with the name `Authorization` and as value `X-OITC-API <API-KEY>`

For Example:

| Name            | Value                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Url Patterns`  | `https://monitoring.itsm.love/*`              |
| `Authorization` | `X-OITC-API fe9ab803c661d712059c0e6c15[...]`  |

![openITCOCKPIT Authorization header](/images/simple_modify_header_firefox_example.png)

You can now access your openITCOCKPIT system without the need to pass any user credentials.

!!! danger
    SimpleModifyHeaders will add this header and your API key to **all requests**. If you use this system to browse the web, make sure to disable SimpleModifyHeaders to avoid leaking your API key.
